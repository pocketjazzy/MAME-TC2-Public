# Advanced notes

Background and reference material that goes beyond the README's quick-start
guides: how cabinet identity actually works, what the launcher does for you,
how to set everything up manually without it, WiFi mode, solo play, headless
and front-end use, and the realities of playing over the internet.

## One program, two folders (how cabinet identity works)

You only need **one** `mametc2.exe`. What makes two running copies different
cabinets is **the folder each one is started from**. The game saves its
settings (cabinet identity, DIP switches, network settings) into the `cfg`
and `nvram` subfolders of the folder it runs in — so:

On one PC, the launcher
maintains the second folder (`instance-b`):
- \TC2-LinkPlay-v0.1\ = the red cabinet's identity
- \TC2-LinkPlay-v0.1\instance-b\ = the blue cabinet's identity

On two PCs, each PC's \TC2-LinkPlay-v0.1\ folder simply *is* its cabinet
(and picking BLUE in the launcher uses an `instance-b` folder there too, so
one PC can play either side).

Settings stick per folder, and the launcher seeds a folder's identity + link
DIP automatically the first time it uses it. If you delete a folder's `cfg`
and `nvram` subfolders, that cabinet forgets its settings — the launcher will
re-seed the identity on the next run, and the game rebuilds its own defaults
(so things like gun calibration reset).

## Playing solo

The game plays perfectly well as a single cabinet: run `.\mametc2.exe
timecrs2` and play. Two things worth knowing:

- After its power-on self test the game briefly shows a countdown (starting
  at 300 — it lasts a few seconds). That countdown is part of the game's
  normal startup and appears whether the **Link Play Enabled** DIP switch is
  on or off. The switch only controls whether the game actually pairs with a
  partner cabinet during it.
- With the switch **On** and no partner found, the game falls back to solo
  play on its own — nothing breaks. For pure solo play the switch can stay
  off; leaving it on costs you nothing but those few startup seconds.

## What the launcher does (and its extras)

`launch_tc2.ps1` option `1` (Local Link Play) automates the one-PC setup:

1. Creates the second cabinet's folder (`instance-b`) next to the program,
   if it doesn't exist yet, and seeds both folders' identities + link DIP
   on the first run.
2. Starts the RED cabinet from the main folder.
3. Waits a moment (the delay you chose) so red is listening first.
4. Starts the BLUE cabinet from `instance-b`, pointed at the same `roms`
   folder — no ROM copy needed.
5. Places the two windows side by side on your screen.

Options `2`/`3` do the same for a network session: `2` runs the RED cabinet
from the script's folder and waits; `3` runs the BLUE cabinet from
`instance-b` and dials RED. The two PCs coordinate over TCP port 9875 (a
3-2-1 countdown, a health check that RED's game actually started, then BLUE
launches) before the game link itself takes over on port 9876.

Useful extras: `-KillExisting` closes any stuck game windows first;
`-SoloListener` / `-SoloConnector` start just one side of a loopback pair;
`-NoPosition` skips the window placement; `-Log` writes MAME's `error.log`
in each cabinet folder (off by default).

## Manual setup without the scripts

### One PC

1. **Folder A** is your main folder: `mametc2.exe` plus `roms\timecrs2.zip`.
2. **Create folder B** anywhere you like (for example `instance-b` inside
   folder A). Inside it, create a plain-text file named `mame.ini`
   containing one line that points at folder A's roms — for example:

   ```
   rompath C:\games\tc2\roms
   ```

3. **Start both copies.** Open a terminal in folder A and run
   `.\mametc2.exe timecrs2`. Then open a second terminal **in folder B** and
   run the same program from there, e.g. `..\mametc2.exe timecrs2`. The
   folder you are *in* is what counts.
4. **Give each window its identity** (Tab → Machine Configuration →
   left/red in one, right/blue in the other), **switch Link Play Enabled on
   in both** (Tab → DIP Switches), close both, and start them again — red
   first, then blue a moment later.

No network setup is needed on one PC — the built-in defaults connect the two
copies through the PC's own internal loopback connection.

### Two PCs

You can skip the launcher and use the in-game **Link Play Config** menu
instead (press Tab; the menu sits between DIP Switches and Machine
Configuration):

- **Red PC:** set *Listener bind IP* (leave `0.0.0.0` to accept from
  anywhere on your network) and *Listener port* (`9876`).
- **Blue PC:** set *Connector target IP* to the **red PC's IP address**, and
  *Connector target port* to `9876`.

Settings are saved in the folder and take effect on the **next** launch.
Then start the red PC's game first, wait a few seconds, and start the blue
PC's game. The red PC still needs the firewall rule described in the README.

## Why the staggered start?

The red side must already be listening when the blue side dials in — if blue
dials first, nobody answers and the pairing can fail. The launcher gets
this right for you: it verifies the red game actually started and survived
its first three seconds (a health check) before it releases the blue side,
plus a small extra delay for margin. If you launch manually, just remember:
**red first, wait a few seconds, then blue.**

## WiFi mode

WiFi works. In the launcher's menu, press **M** to select **WiFi** mode on
**both** PCs (the choice is remembered, alongside the IPs and your last menu
choice, in `launcher_settings.json`). WiFi mode widens the in-game
partner-search countdown
(the counter starts at 600 on the red side and 450 on the blue side —
roughly double the standard 300) to give the pairing extra margin on a less
predictable connection. For the smoothest play, wired Ethernet is still the
best choice — but a decent modern WiFi network holds up fine.

## Playing over the internet

Technically possible, and it has been done: forward TCP ports 9875-9876 on
the red player's router to the red PC, and have the blue player enter the
red player's public IP. But be warned: the two games run in **tight
lockstep** — every frame is coordinated. That makes the link sensitive to
latency; internet delay slows the game down **for both players**, and
playability over the internet is **not guaranteed**. This build is designed
for a local network; the internet is an experiment you run at your own risk
(of frustration).

## Headless & front-end integration

For front-ends (LaunchBox/BigBox and friends), boot-to-game dedicated
cabinets, or your own wrapper scripts, the launcher runs fully
non-interactive. `-Unattended` guarantees it never stops at a prompt, and
`-Fullscreen` gives the dedicated-cabinet look:

```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launch_tc2.ps1 -Mode Loopback -Unattended
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launch_tc2.ps1 -Mode LanRed  -Unattended -Fullscreen
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File launch_tc2.ps1 -Mode LanBlue -ListenerIP 192.168.1.10 -Unattended -Fullscreen
```

- `-Mode Loopback | LanRed | LanBlue` picks what the menu's `1`/`2`/`3` pick.
  With `-Unattended` and no `-Mode`, the last saved menu choice is reused.
- Everything the menu can set has a parameter: `-ListenerIP` (RED's address),
  `-ConnectorIP`, `-Network Ethernet|WiFi`, `-DelaySeconds`, `-StaggerMs`,
  `-WorkDir <folder>` (use a specific cabinet folder), `-Log` (write MAME's
  error.log, off by default).
- With `-Unattended`, first-run cabinet seeding still happens, and any
  identity/DIP fix that would normally prompt is applied automatically.
- Exit code is `0` on a successful launch and `1` on any failure, so a
  wrapper can react.

### Launching mametc2.exe directly (no script at all)

The game itself is front-end friendly. A cabinet folder that has been set up
once (by the launcher or the Tab menu) boots straight into link play with a
bare command from that folder:

```
.\mametc2.exe timecrs2
```

Network settings resolve in this order: command line, then the folder's
saved **Link Play Config**, then loopback defaults — and the cabinet's
red/blue identity decides whether it listens or connects. Useful arguments:

- `-comm_localport 9876 -comm_remotehost ""` — force the RED/listener role.
- `-comm_remotehost <redIP> -comm_remoteport 9876` — force the BLUE/connector
  role, aimed at the red PC.
- `-rompath <folder>` — where `timecrs2.zip` lives.
- `-cfg_directory <path>` and `-nvram_directory <path>` — point one exe at
  any cabinet identity folder **without** changing the working directory
  (handy when a front-end fixes the working directory).
- The WiFi pairing-window widening is an environment variable, settable in
  any wrapper: `NAMCOS23_PATCH_LINK_WAIT=60` on red / `45` on blue.

One caveat: direct launches skip the launcher's rendezvous and health check,
so the ordering is on you — **start red first, wait a few seconds, then
start blue** within the partner-search countdown.

## The golden rule

The session runs at the pace of the **slower machine**. If one PC can't hold
full speed on its own, the linked session can't either — both players feel
it. On one PC, remember that two game windows are roughly twice the work.
